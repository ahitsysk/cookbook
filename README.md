  </a>
</p>

Enjoy our curated collection of examples and recipes for [MultiOn](https://www.multion.ai/api). Use these patterns to build your own Agentic applications. We're going to be shipping new examples weekly. Stay tuned!

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll need an MultiOn account and API key (sign up [here](https://app.multion.ai)).

Some recipes use the Agent API in local mode, which requires the MultiOn Chrome Extension (install [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/multion/ddmjhdbknfidiopmbaceghhhbgbpenmm)).
